ON 9 JANUARY 2009, THE SETTLEMENT REACHED BY LLOYDS TSB BANK PLC WITH BOTH THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE NEW YORK COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN RELATION TO THEIR INVESTIGATIONS WAS ANNOUNCED. THE SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTATION CONTAINS DETAILS OF THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RELATING TO IRAN, SUDAN AND LIBYA WHICH LLOYDS TSB BANK PLC CONDUCTED DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD. IN 2008 LLOYDS TSB BANK PLC MADE A PROVISION OF £180 MILLION WHICH FULLY COVERED THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT PAID TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE NEW YORK COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. ON 22 DECEMBER 2009, OFAC ANNOUNCED THE SETTLEMENT IT HAD REACHED WITH LLOYDS TSB BANK PLC IN RELATION TO ITS INVESTIGATION AND CONFIRMED THAT THE SETTLEMENT SUM DUE TO OFAC HAD BEEN FULLY SATISFIED BY LLOYDS TSB BANK PLC'S PAYMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE NEW YORK COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. NO FURTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ARE EXPECTED IN RELATION TO THE MATTERS SET OUT IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. A PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER FILED A DERIVATIVE CIVIL ACTION IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW YORK, NASSAU COUNTY ON 26 FEBRUARY 2009 AGAINST CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS, AND NOMINALLY AGAINST LLOYDS TSB BANK PLC AND LLOYDS BANKING GROUP, SEEKING VARIOUS FORMS OF RELIEF FOLLOWING THE SETTLEMENT.
