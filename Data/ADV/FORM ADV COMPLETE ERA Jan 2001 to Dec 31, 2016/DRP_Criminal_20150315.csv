CURRENTLY THIS CASE IS ON APPEAL WITH THE REGIONAL FEDERAL TRIBUNAL OF THE 3RD REGION UNDER JUDGE VESNA KOLMAR. NOTICE OF APPEAL WAS GIVEN ON JULY 29, 2004 AND THE APPEAL WAS FILED ON JULY 4, 2005 .","THE CHARGE RELATES TO A 1992 TRANSACTION BY BANQUE NATIONALE DE PARIS (BNP), MR. ROSAS' EMPLOYER AT THE TIME.  BNP, AS A PROPRIETARY INVESTMENT, BROUGHT CURRENCY INTO BRAZIL USING THE COMMERCIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET AND HEDGED ITS INVESTMENT EXITING THROUGH THE FLOATING MARKET. BOTH LEGS OF THE TRANSACTION WERE LEGAL UNDER LOCAL REGULATIONS EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME, WERE APPROVED BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF BRAZIL, AND WERE REPORTED AT THE TIME OF EXECUTION TO THE AUTHORITIES AT THE CENTRAL BANK BY CITIBANK (WHICH ACTED AS FX DEALER TO BNP FOR THE TRANSACTION).  MR. ROSAS ACTED FOR BNP AS ATTORNEY-IN-FACT AND SENIOR EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES.  THE OFFICERS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION ACTED IN GOOD FAITH, SUPPORTED BY A FAVORABLE LEGAL OPINION FROM PROMINENT EXTERNAL LEGAL COUNSEL IN BRAZIL.  AT THE TIME THE SUIT WAS FILED, SEVERAL OTHER SUITS WERE FILED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTORS IN BRAZIL AGAINST MORE THAN 30 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, QUESTIONING EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE OF TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO 8 YEARS PREVIOUSLY.  THE CASE WAS BROUGHT BY THE FEDERAL PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, NOT THE BRAZIL CENTRAL BANK.  PUBLIC PROSECUTORS IN BRAZIL HAVE WIDE DISCRETION TO ALLEGE INTERPRETATIONS OF REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE CURRENCY MARKETS WHICH ARE AT ODDS WITH THE CENTRAL BANK'S OWN INTERPRETATIONS.  THE CASE WAS COMMENCED SHORTLY BEFORE EXPIRY OF THE RELEVANT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, SO THE TIMING OF THE SUIT MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THAT EXPIRY DATE.  ALTHOUGH MR. ROSAS IS AWARE THAT SIMILAR CHARGES WERE FILED AGAINST SEVERAL OTHER INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SAME TYPE OF TRANSACTIONS, HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PROSECUTOR'S MOTIVATIONS FOR BRINGING THE SUIT.  THE PROSECUTOR CONTENDED THAT, SINCE THE COMBINATION OF THE TWO LEGS OF THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A CAPITAL OUTFLOW, IT CONTRAVENED CERTAIN CAPITAL CONTROLS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME, EVEN THOUGH THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE TRANSACTION WERE ALL LEGAL.  THE SUIT HAS NOT ADVERSELY AFFECTED MR. ROSAS' PARTICIPATION AS A SENIOR EXECUTIVE IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.  TWO REGULATORY BODIES IN BRAZIL GRANTED THE FOLLOWING APPROVALS AFTER THE SUIT WAS FILED:  (A) APPROVAL BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF BRAZIL OF MR. ROSAS AS STATUTORY DIRECTOR OF UNIBANCO, RESPONSIBLE FOR TREASURY OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD OF 2002-2004; AND  (B) APPROVAL BY THE COMISSÃO DE VALORES MOBILIÁRIOS - CVM (SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OF BRAZIL) OF MR. ROSAS AS  PRESIDENT OF UNIBANCO ASSET MANAGEMENT AND AS APPROVED ASSET MANAGER.  THE JUDGEMENT AGAINST MR. ROSAS WAS A NOMINAL FINE OF $10,000 AND COMMUNITY SERVICE, WITH NO FURTHER CONSEQUENCES POSSIBLE.  DESPITE THE NOMINAL SIZE OF THE FINE, MR. ROSAS IS APPEALING TO CLEAR THE RECORD AND IS CONFIDENT OF A FAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME.  UNDER BRAZILIAN LAW, THE APPEALS COURT HAS UNTIL JULY 15, 2012 TO CONSIDER THE APPEAL; IF NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE APPEALS COURT BY THAT DATE, THE ORIGINAL CONVICTION WILL BE VOIDED."

GARCÍA. THE RULING BY THE ARGENTINE COURT OF APPEALS WAS BASED ON A CERTAIN REBUTTABLE LEGAL PRESUMPTION UNDER THE ARGENTINE PENAL TAX REGIME WHICH PRESUMES THAT, BY THEIR MERE POSITION AS MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ALL DIRECTORS OF AN ARGENTINE COMPANY COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED WRONGDOING. THEREFORE, THE APPEALS COURT FOUND THAT WHETHER THE CHARGES AGAINST A PARTICULAR DIRECTOR (SUCH AS MR. GARCIA) COULD BE DISMISSED IN A GIVEN CASE IS A FACTUAL MATTER SUBJECT TO A CASE-BY-CASE DETERMINATION. THE CASE IS CURRENTLY AWAITING TRIAL, BUT MR. GARCÍA HAS APPEALED HIS INCLUSION IN THE CASE AND HIS APPEAL MUST BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE TRIAL ON THE AFIP'S CHARGES CAN COMMENCE. MEANWHILE, MR. GARCÍA'S COUNSEL HAS STARTED TO DISCUSS WITH THE INTERVENING PROSECUTORS THE POSSIBILITY OF RELEASING MR. GARCIA FROM THE CASE THROUGH ""PROBATION"", WHICH WOULD AVOID THE PROSECUTION OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM WITHOUT ACCEPTING ANY ROLE OR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ALLEGED WRONGDOING BY CEZA.  MR.

THE AFIP APPEALED THE COURT'S DECISION ON LEGAL GROUNDS AND OBTAINED A RULING FROM THE INTERVENING ARGENTINE COURT OF APPEALS ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2008 REINSTATING THE INDICTMENT AGAINST ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CEZA, INCLUDING MR. GARCÍA. THE RULING BY THE ARGENTINE COURT OF APPEALS WAS BASED ON A CERTAIN REBUTTABLE LEGAL PRESUMPTION UNDER THE ARGENTINE PENAL TAX REGIME WHICH PRESUMES THAT, BY THEIR MERE POSITION AS MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ALL DIRECTORS OF AN ARGENTINE COMPANY COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED WRONGDOING. THEREFORE, THE APPEALS COURT FOUND THAT WHETHER THE CHARGES AGAINST A PARTICULAR DIRECTOR (SUCH AS MR. GARCIA) COULD BE DISMISSED IN A GIVEN CASE IS A FACTUAL MATTER SUBJECT TO A CASE-BY-CASE DETERMINATION. THE CASE IS CURRENTLY AWAITING TRIAL, BUT MR. GARCÍA HAS APPEALED HIS INCLUSION IN THE CASE AND HIS APPEAL MUST BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE TRIAL ON THE AFIP'S CHARGES CAN COMMENCE. MEANWHILE, MR. GARCÍA'S COUNSEL HAS STARTED TO DISCUSS WITH THE INTERVENING PROSECUTORS THE POSSIBILITY OF RELEASING MR. GARCIA FROM THE CASE THROUGH ""PROBATION"", WHICH WOULD AVOID THE PROSECUTION OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM WITHOUT ACCEPTING ANY ROLE OR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ALLEGED WRONGDOING BY CEZA.  MR. GARCÍA SERVED AS DIRECTOR OF CEZA WHILE HE WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF CS AND IS BEING COVERED BY THE TERMS, AS APPLICABLE, OF CS'S INDEMNIFICATION POLICIES.",PLEASE SEE EXPLANATION IN RESPONSE TO PRIOR QUESTIONS 3B AND 4 ABOVE.

THREE OTHER BANK AND MORE THAN  130 INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING EXECUTIVES AND TOP MANAGEMENT OF THESE BANKS, HAVE ALSO BEEN REFERRED FOR TRIAL IN THE SAME MATTER. THE CHARGES AGAINST SG ARE FOR ""AGGRAVATED MONEY LAUNDERING"" IN PROCESSING CHECK-CASHING TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN FRANCE AND ISRAEL FROM EARLY 1998 TO DECEMBER 2001. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE ALLEGES THAT STOLEN CHECKS WERE SENT TO ISRAEL, WHERE THEY WERE CASHED BY A LOCAL BANK OR BY A LOCAL EXCHANGE OFFICE. THE CHECKS WERE THEN RETURNED BY THE ISRAELI BANK TO A FRENCH CORRESPONDENT BANK, ONE OF WHICH WAS SG. SG THEN ALLEGEDLY FORWARDED THE CHECKS TO THE FRENCH CLEARING HOUSE, WHICH IN TURN FORWARDED THEM FOR PAYMENT TO THE BANK ON WHICH THEY WERE DRAWN. THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE'S DECISION TO FILE CHARGES AGAINST SG CONTRADICTED THE PREVIOUS FORMAL RECOMMENDATION OF THE FRENCH STATE PROSECUTOR, FOLLOWING AN INVESTIGATION THAT HAD LASTED OVER SIX YEARS, THAT THE CASE BE DISMISSED BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. THE REFERENCED PROCEEDINGS RELATE SOLELY TO THE ULTIMATE PARENT COMPANY OF THE REGISTRANT IN PARIS, FRANCE AND HAVE NO BEARING ON OR RELATIONSHIP TO THE BUSINESS OF THE REGISTRANT."

SPINOLA'S COUNSEL BELIEVES THAT MR. SPINOLA WAS ERRONEOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AGAINST TASA GIVEN THAT THE PROSECUTORS WERE BASING THEIR CASE AGAINST MR.

SPINOLA WAS AN OFFICER OF AN INVESTMENT HOLDING VEHICLE THAT CONTROLLED TASA, A COMPANY CALLED TECHNOS RELÓGIOS S.A. (""TERESA"").  TERESA WAS MERGED INTO TASA IN MAY 2008, AS A RESULT OF WHICH TERESA CEASED TO EXIST.  MR. SPINOLA IS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF TASA, BUT HE HAS NO EXECUTIVE DUTIES OR POWERS IN RESPECT OF TASA AND IS NOT (AND HAS NEVER BEEN) AN OFFICER OF TASA (EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE MERGER WITH TERESA).

SPINOLA'S COUNSEL FILED A WRITTEN ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST MR. SPINOLA, TOGETHER WITH DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF MR. SPINOLA'S NON-EXECUTIVE POSITION AT TASA. NOTWITHSTANDING THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THE WRITTEN ANSWER, THE CRIMINAL JUDGE DECIDED TO SUBMIT THE CASE FOR TRIAL.  IN LIGHT OF SUCH DECISION, THE LITIGATION IS CURRENTLY IN ITS THE DISCOVERY PHASE AND THE WITNESSES NAMED BY THE PARTIES ARE BEING HEARD BEFORE THE CRIMINAL JUDGE AND THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR. AFTER THAT, MR. SPINOLA AND THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS CHARGED IN THE LITIGATION WILL BE INTERROGATED BY THE AUTHORITIES. AS MR. SPINOLA WAS ERRONEOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT, ON JULY 13, 2012, HIS COUNSEL FILED AN HABEAS CORPUS WITH THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE STATE OF RIO DE JANEIRO, SEEKING TO DISMISS THE CHARGES AGAINST MR.

GARCÍA. THE RULING BY THE ARGENTINE COURT OF APPEALS WAS BASED ON A CERTAIN REBUTTABLE LEGAL PRESUMPTION UNDER THE ARGENTINE PENAL TAX REGIME WHICH PRESUMES THAT, BY THEIR MERE POSITION AS MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ALL DIRECTORS OF AN ARGENTINE COMPANY COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ALLEGED WRONGDOING. THE CASE IS CURRENTLY AWAITING TRIAL, BUT MR. GARCÍA HAS APPEALED HIS INCLUSION IN THE CASE AND HIS APPEAL MUST BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE TRIAL ON THE AFIP'S CHARGES CAN COMMENCE. MR. GARCÍA'S COUNSEL HAS PETITIONED THE COURT TO DISMISS TWO OF THE THREE CHARGES AGAINST MR. GARCÍA ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE ALLEGED TAX AMOUNTS IN QUESTION ARE BELOW THE MINIMUM AMOUNTS REQUIRED TO PERMIT SUCH CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST MR. GARCÍA BASED ON A NEW LAW THAT WAS PASSED WHILE THE CASE WAS PENDING. MR. GARCÍA'S COUNSEL HAS ALSO PETITIONED THE COURT TO DISMISS THE THIRD CHARGE ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE LONG PERIOD THAT HAS LAPSED WITHOUT A TRIAL ON THE MATTER VIOLATES MR.

THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE IN SAO PAULO INITIATED A LAWSUIT BEFORE THE COURT IN NOVEMBER 2012 AGAINST A MUNICIPAL OFFICIAL, REAL ESTATE CONSULTANTS, MR. LIMA, MR. VASCONCELOS AND OTHERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAZIL AFFILIATE, WHICH WAS ACCEPTED BY THE JUDGE AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2013.  BROOKFIELD BROUGHT THE ALLEGATIONS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND LAUNCHED AN INDEPENDENT  INVESTIGATION BY A MAJOR NEW YORK BASED LAW FIRM TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ALLEGATIONS.  THE EIGHT MONTH INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN COMPREHENSIVE AND THOROUGH.  THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE AND THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE PAYMENTS MADE BY THE BRAZIL AFFILIATE TO CONSULTANTS WERE USED TO PAY BRIBES TO MUNICIPAL OFFICIALS OR THAT THE OFFICERS."
