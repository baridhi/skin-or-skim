Section9.c.Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) serves as the independent public accounting firm for the following private funds which are advised by RREEF America L.L.C.:RREEF Real Estate Securities Commingled Fund, RREEF Real Estate Securities Commingled Fund - Series A, and RREEF Real Estate Securities Commingled Fund - Series B (each a “Fund”).EY has advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified the following matters that it determined to be inconsistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) auditor independence rules.A)EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds of financial relationships held by covered persons within EY that were in violation of the Rule 2-01(c)(1)of Regulation S-X.EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breaches did not and do not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.In assessing this matter, EY indicated that upon detection the breaches were corrected promptly and that none of the breaches(i)related to financial relationships directly in the Funds,(ii)involved professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team, or(iii)were for services directly for the Funds.B)EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that,in 2016, a pension plan for the Ernst & Young Global Limited (“EYG”) member firm in Germany (“EY Germany”),through one of its investment advisors, purchased an investment in an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds.EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that this investment was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(i)of Regulation S-X.EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance, EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagement.EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audit of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.In reaching this conclusion,EY noted a number of factors, including that the purchase was by EY Germany’s investment advisor without EY Germany’s permission, authorization or knowledge and EY Germany instructed its investment advisor to sell the shares of the entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Fund immediately upon detection of the purchase and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.In addition,EY noted that the independence breach did not(i)create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds,(ii)place EY in the position of auditing its own work,(iii)result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds, or (iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.(C)EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that, in 2014, the EYG member firm in Spain (“EY Spain”) completed an acquisition of a small consulting firm that had a deposit account with an overdraft line of credit at the time of the acquisition with Deutsche Bank SA Espanola, which EY Spain acquired.EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that having this line of credit with an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)of Regulation S-X.EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance,EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagements.EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules,EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion. In reaching this conclusion,EY noted a number of factors,including that that the credit line was terminated and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.In addition,EY noted that the independence breach did not(i)create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds,(ii)place EY in the position of auditing its own work,(iii)result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds,or(iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.EY believes that the above described matters, individually and in the aggregate, do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.Those in charge of governance of the Funds considered these matters and, based solely upon EY’s description of the facts and the representations made by EY, believe that(1)these matters did not impact EY’s application of objective and impartial judgment with respect to all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements; and(2)a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.EY also informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified independence breaches where EY and covered persons maintain lending relationships with owners of greater than 10% of the shares of certain investment companies that are under common control with the Funds.EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that these lending relationships are inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(l)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the “Loan Rule”).The Loan Rule specifically provides that an accounting firm would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of an audit client’s equity securities.For purposes of the Loan Rule,audit clients include the Funds as well as all registered investment companies advised by the REEF Americas L.L.C. (the“Adviser”), the Funds’ investment adviser, and its affiliates, including other subsidiaries of the Adviser’s parent company, Deutsche Bank AG (collectively, the “Deutsche Funds Complex”).EY’s lending relationships effect EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to all companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex.EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that, after evaluating the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY has concluded that the lending relationships described above do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that its conclusion was based on a number of factors, including, among others, EY’s belief that the lenders are not able to impact the impartiality of EY or assert any influence over the investment companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex whose shares the lenders own or the applicable investment company’s investment adviser.In addition, the individuals at EY who arranged EY’s lending relationships have no oversight of,or ability to influence, the individuals at EY who conducted the audits of the Funds’ financial statements.On June 20, 2016, the SEC Staff issued a “no-action” letter to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management & Research Company et al.,No-Action Letter) related to similar Loan Rule issues as those described above.In that letter,the SEC Staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an investment company that relied on the audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances.The circumstances described in the no-action letter appear to be substantially similar to the circumstances that effected EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to the Funds.EY confirmed to those in charge of governance of the Funds that it meets all the conditions of the no-action letter.EY and the Funds believe that the Funds can rely on the no-action letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by EY.In the no-action letter, the SEC Staff stated that the relief under the letter is temporary and will expire 18 months after the issuance of the letter.",,,,

1028426,"Related persons of the registrant who serve as general partners, commodity pool operators or managers of pooled investment vehicles or as other investment advisers that are not listed on section 7.A. of this Schedule D are listed on the Form ADV of one or more of the following affiliated investment advisers that are separately registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): (i) Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-50462); (ii) AlpInvest Partners B.V. (SEC File no. 801-72890); and (iii) Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation (SEC File no. 801-66469).  The minimum investment commitment indicated for any private fund may be reduced in the discretion of the applicable general partner or the registrant.  Certain private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D hold certain investments through, or in parallel with, special purpose holding companies or alternative investment vehicles organized to address tax, regulatory or structural considerations in connection with certain transactions.   With respect to Item 27 of section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D, as a manager of real estate fund-of-funds, the registrant relies heavily on the valuations provided by the underlying private investment fund managers. The registrant conducts independent due diligence to gain comfort with the values provided and the assumptions and conditions used to generate the fair market values of the underlying private investment fund’s asset and liabilities. The registrant has the ability to make fair market value adjustments, but has only done so very limited circumstances since inception.  Certain private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D (the “Global Funds”) were established specifically to solely invest in two or more other private funds of the registrant.  Because the Global Funds do not invest in a single master fund, they are not identified as feeder funds for purposes of section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D.  Further, the allocable portion of gross asset amounts provided for each such private fund also will be reflected in the gross asset amount for the relevant other private funds of the registrant in which they invest. Additionally, for purposes of reporting the ownership information for the underlying private funds of the registrant in which such Global Fund holds an interest, the registrant has looked through such Global Funds to their respective limited partners as if they invested directly in the private funds of the registrant. With respect to the registrant’s regulatory assets under management and gross asset values that consist of interests in underlying private investment funds or vehicles managed by third-party investment managers, the fair market value of such interests as of December 31, 2015 is based on the latest available valuations of such interests as provided by such third-party investment managers as of September 30, 2015, plus the net cash flows (i.e., capital calls and distributions) since such date, up to and including December 31, 2015.  All non-USD based cash flows and fair market values have been converted from the actual relevant currency to USD using fx rates as of December 31, 2015.  The gross asset amounts provided for each private fund listed in section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D do not include the amount of uncalled capital commitments to such private fund.   None of the registrant’s private funds or other advisory clients currently trade commodity interests. Nevertheless, the registrant and certain of its related persons are currently relying on CFTC No-Action Letter No 12-38 relief from the registration requirement for commodity pool operators of fund-of-funds that otherwise may have to register (or rely on another exemption from registration) as a result of their indirect exposure to commodity interests.  Accordingly, the registrant has responded in the affirmative to the questions in Item 6.A that it is actively engaged as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading adviser (even though the registrant does not believe this to be the case). In addition to registrations with foreign financial regulatory authorities (if any) disclosed in this Form ADV, the registrant has sought authorization to market certain private fund clients in various non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to applicable private placement or similar regimes.",,,,

These trading, research and related services include, among other things, execution of transactions, access to meetings with various financial institutions, and other information sources. The transactions for funds and accounts managed by this independent advisory entity are generally subject to VAAM’s trading policies and procedures, including those governing trade allocations. The commissions and other revenues these funds and accounts generate for broker-dealers and other financial institutions are seen as coming from VAAM’s trading desk and generally help VAAM obtain better services and allocations on behalf of funds and clients from these broker-dealers and financial institutions; the commissions and other revenues generated by these funds and accounts may be considered by both VAAM and underwriters in allocating initial public offerings (“IPOs”) and other offerings.

1028415,"Further to item 3.A of Form ADV Part 1A, the registrant is a private company limited by shares (besloten vennootschap) organized under the laws of the Netherlands and is based in Amsterdam. Its form of organization is similar to that of a corporation in the United States. The registrant is also licensed with the Netherlands Authority of Financial Markets as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the European Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (“AIFMD”). Certain investment vehicles managed by the registrant are “Alternative Investment Funds” within the meaning of AIFMD. Related persons of the registrant who serve as general partners, commodity pool operators or managers of pooled investment vehicles or as other investment advisers that are not listed on section 7.A. of this Schedule D are listed on the Form ADV of one or more of the following affiliated investment advisers that are separately registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): (i) Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-50462); (ii) Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management, LLC (SEC File no. 801-65113); and (iii) Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation (SEC File no. 801-66469).  The minimum investment commitment indicated for any private fund may be reduced in the discretion of the applicable general partner or the registrant.  Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D hold certain investments through, or in parallel with, special purpose holding companies or alternative investment vehicles organized to address tax, regulatory or structural considerations in connection with certain transactions.   Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D make co-investments in portfolio companies alongside private equity funds. In most cases, the lead sponsor of the buyout transaction will structure the co-investment such that the AlpInvest private fund invests via a dedicated co-investment vehicle controlled by the lead sponsor. Additionally, certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D that invest in other private equity funds or venture funds will receive from time to time distributions of marketable securities from the underlying fund, which securities are later sold on the open market. For purposes of Form ADV, the registrant treats all such private funds as a fund-of-funds regardless of the amount of their exposure to direct investments.  Additionally, certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) – AMC 2012 Ltd., AMC 2013 Ltd., AMC 2014 Ltd. and AMC 2015 Ltd. – are feeder vehicles organized outside the United States and established solely for the purpose of allowing certain senior investment professionals of the registrant and its affiliates to co-invest in special purpose non-U.S. investment vehicles established in respect of a single non-U.S. advisory client’s managed account as required by under the investment management agreement with such advisory client (which came into effect prior to the registrant’s registration with the SEC as an investment adviser). Such non-U.S. investment vehicles are subject to an annual review by the registrant’s independent accounting firm in accordance with the agreement with the advisory client.  Further, the registrant manages other pooled investment vehicles that (i) are organized outside of the United States and (ii) do not have any direct investors who are U.S. persons.  The registrant takes the position that such vehicles are generally outside the scope of Form ADV and most other federal securities laws and therefore are not reported as private funds.  Such investments vehicles are audited (if at all) in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such investment vehicles.  With respect to Item 27 of Section 7.B.(1), as a manager of private equity fund-of-funds, the registrant relies heavily on the valuations provided by the underlying private investment fund managers. The registrant conducts independent due diligence to gain comfort with the values provided and the assumptions and conditions used to generate the fair market values of the underlying private investment fund’s asset and liabilities. The registrant has the ability to make fair market value adjustments, but has only done so very limited circumstances since inception.  With respect to the registrant’s regulatory assets under management and gross asset values that consist of interests in underlying private investment funds or vehicles managed by third-party investment managers, the fair market value of such interests as of December 31, 2015 is based on the latest available valuations of such interests as provided by such third-party investment managers as of September 30, 2015, plus the net cash flows (i.e., capital calls and distributions) since such date, up to and including December 31, 2015.  All non-USD based cash flows and fair market values have been converted from the actual relevant currency to USD using fx rates as of December 31, 2015.  The gross asset amounts provided for each private fund listed in section 7.B.(1) do not include the amount of uncalled capital commitments to such private fund. The registrant and Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. each provide advisory services with respect to a certain private fund (and the manager thereof) within Carlyle’s Investment Solutions business segment. Each of the registrant and Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. has included the approximately $149 million related to such fund within such adviser’s respective total regulatory assets under management.  In addition to registrations with foreign financial regulatory authorities (if any) disclosed in this Form ADV, the registrant has sought authorization to market certain private fund clients in various non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to applicable private placement or similar regimes. None of the registrant’s private funds or other advisory clients currently trade commodity interests. Nevertheless, the registrant and certain of its related persons are currently relying on CFTC No-Action Letter No 12-38 relief from the registration requirement for commodity pool operators of fund-of-funds that otherwise may have to register (or rely on another exemption from registration) as a result of their indirect exposure to commodity interests in respect of its U.S. advisory clients and other advisory clients with U.S. investors.  Accordingly, the registrant has responded in the affirmative to the questions in Item 6.A that it is actively engaged as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading adviser (even though the registrant does not believe this to be the case). The registrant currently does not have a chief executive officer; however, the responsibilities of this position are primarily carried out by the registrant’s Chief Financial and Operating Officer and the head of Carlyle’s Investment Solutions business segment.",,,,

The primary investment funds and separate accounts that we manage generally invest a significant portion of their assets directly or indirectly in other pooled vehicles (referred to as ""implementation funds"") which we also manage and through which we pursue our investment strategies for our primary funds and separate accounts (e.g. cash management investments are aggregated in a liquidity fund). These implementation funds do not charge management or incentive fees, do not have investors other than the funds and accounts that we manage, and are used solely for the purpose of obtaining efficient execution of our transactional activities and for reducing administrative burdens related to our primary funds and separate accounts. The assets of these implementation funds that were contributed by the primary funds and separate accounts have not been included in our RAUM or in our amount of custodied assets since we believe that, like a master feeder arrangement, this would result in the double counting of assets that we manage and custody.

The response in Q. 21 will be “No” for a master fund if it relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, while one or more consolidated feeder funds will have relied upon Reg. D promulgated under such Act. With respect to Q. 28, while a feeder fund may have utilized a marketer in respect of its investors, generally a master fund would not require such services.     Q.28: The agreement between the Advisor and any marketer listed in Q. 28 may include affiliates of the marketer.  Q. 23 for 12th Avenue Employee Participation Plan, LLC: For 12th Avenue Employee Participation Plan, LLC, the response to Q. 23(a) is “no” and responses to Q. 23(b-h) are left blank because this fund is not individually audited.

We are not able to provide information concerning the audit PAG believes would be required with respect to a fund managed by Aequitas Investment Management, an investment adviser under common control with PAG through the court-appointed receiver responsible for overseeing Aequitas-related receivership entities. PAG does not itself have custody of client assets (and does not currently deduct fees from any Aequitas-related investment held in PAG client accounts) and is not required to obtain audits under the custody rule. PAG typically obtains information about the audit from Aequitas' affiliates. The Aequitas affiliates have been taken over by the court-appointed receiver.

In the Receivership Order entered by the court, numerous Aequitas affiliates, including Aspen Grove, were deemed ""Receivership Entities.""  The Receivership Order further directed that ""The trustees, directors, officers, members of the  Receivership Entity are hereby dismissed and the powers of any general partners, directors, members and/or managers are hereby suspended."" Control of the Receivership Entities is now in the hands of the receiver, Ronald F. Greenspan. Accordingly, we have removed all other indirect owners and retained only Aspen Grove. We have requested identifying information that will permit us to add Mr. Greenspan directly to the Schedule B, but we have not yet obtained it.

1035187,"On March 22, 2016, KPMG informed the Adviser that KPMG has an outstanding note payable to an entity that is a greater than 10% owner of the Limited Partnership Interests in Mudrick Distressed Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the “Onshore Feeder Fund”) resulting in a breach of Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X with respect solely to the audit of the Onshore Feeder Fund. KPMG further informed the Adviser that this breach impacts KPMG’s compliance with the SEC independence rules applicable to their audit of the financial statements of the Onshore Feeder Fund performed pursuant to the Custody Rule (i.e., Rule 206(4)-2) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Onshore Feeder Fund is treated herein as a feeder fund with respect to Mudrick Distressed Opportunity Fund Global, L.P. (the ""Master Fund"") according to the instructions to this Section 7.B.(1) due to the fact that, among other reasons, the Onshore Feeder Fund, alongside Mudrick Distressed Fund Offshore, Ltd. (the “Offshore Feeder Fund”), currently invests its investable assets in the Master Fund. All investments, other than certain cash management and similar investments pending cash inflows and outflows, in this structure are held, and investment activity takes place, at the Master Fund level. As a result, investment valuation and related work conducted by KPMG during their audits takes place at the Master Fund level. KPMG has confirmed to the Adviser that the above described breach does not impact KPMG’s compliance with the SEC independence rules applicable to their audits of the financial statements of the Master Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund. In addition, KPMG has confirmed that its audits, including its audit of the Onshore Feeder Fund, were performed in accordance with both the AICPA auditing standards and independence rules and the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards in the United States. KPMG has also represented to the Adviser that, after evaluating the facts and circumstances related to this matter, its financial relationship described above did not and will not impact KPMG’s application of objective and impartial judgment on any issues encompassed within their audits of the financial statements of the Onshore Feeder Fund. After independently evaluating the facts and circumstances related to this matter and conducting interviews with certain KPMG personnel, the Adviser has come to the same conclusion. Despite the foregoing, in order to ensure that it remains in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations on an ongoing basis, the Adviser retained EisnerAmper LLP to conduct a second audit of the financial statements of the Domestic Feeder Fund for the year ended December 31, 2015. On August 12th, 2016, EisnerAmper LLP completed their audit and produced financial statements and an independent auditors’ report of the Onshore Feeder Fund. As expected, there were no material discrepancies between the audited financial statements prepared by KPMG and the audited financial statements prepared by EisnerAmper LLP. As such, and based on the factors described above, the audited financial statements prepared by KPMG will continue to be used as the Onshore Feeder Fund’s official audited financial statements. The EisnerAmper audited financial statements are available to all investors in the Onshore Feeder Fund upon request.",,,,

The co-investment vehicles do not pay advisory fees to the Registrants, and key employees may receive loans from the Registrants or their affiliates with respect to a significant portion of their investment in the co-investment vehicles.

1036934,"Section 9.C. Independent Public Accountant -         Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) serves as the independent public accounting firm for the following private funds which are advised by Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc.: Deutsche Global Commodities QP Trust and Deutsche Stock Index Fund (each a “Fund”).           EY has advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified the following matters that it determined to be inconsistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) auditor independence rules.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds of financial relationships held by covered persons within EY that were in violation of the Rule 2-01(c)(1) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breaches did not and do not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.  In assessing this matter, EY indicated that upon detection the breaches were corrected promptly and that none of the breaches (i) related to financial relationships directly in the Funds, (ii) involved professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team, or (iii) were for services directly for the Funds.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that, in 2016, a pension plan for the Ernst & Young Global Limited (“EYG”) member firm in Germany (“EY Germany”), through one of its investment advisors, purchased an investment in an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that this investment was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(i) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance, EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagement.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audit of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.  In reaching this conclusion, EY noted a number of factors, including that the purchase was by EY Germany’s investment advisor without EY Germany’s permission, authorization or knowledge and EY Germany instructed its investment advisor to sell the shares of the entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Fund immediately upon detection of the purchase and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.  In addition, EY noted that the independence breach did not (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds, (ii) place EY in the position of auditing its own work, (iii) result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds, or (iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that, in 2014, the EYG member firm in Spain (“EY Spain”) completed an acquisition of a small consulting firm that had a deposit account with an overdraft line of credit at the time of the acquisition with Deutsche Bank SA Espanola, which EY Spain acquired.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that having this line of credit with an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance, EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagements.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion. In reaching this conclusion, EY noted a number of factors, including that that the credit line was terminated and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.  In addition, EY noted that the independence breach did not (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds, (ii) place EY in the position of auditing its own work, (iii) result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds, or (iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.         EY believes that the above described matters, individually and in the aggregate, do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.   Those in charge of governance of the Funds considered these matters and, based solely upon EY’s description of the facts and the representations made by EY, believe that (1) these matters did not impact EY’s application of objective and impartial judgment with respect to all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements; and (2) a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.        EY also informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified independence breaches where EY and covered persons maintain lending relationships with owners of greater than 10% of the shares of certain investment companies that are under common control with the Funds.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that these lending relationships are inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(l)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the “Loan Rule”).        The Loan Rule specifically provides that an accounting firm would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of an audit client’s equity securities.  For purposes of the Loan Rule, audit clients include the Funds as well as all registered investment companies advised by the Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. (the “Adviser”), the Funds’ investment adviser, and its affiliates, including other subsidiaries of the Adviser’s parent company, Deutsche Bank AG (collectively, the “Deutsche Funds Complex”).  EY’s lending relationships effect EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to all companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex.        EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that, after evaluating the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY has concluded that the lending relationships described above do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that its conclusion was based on a number of factors, including, among others, EY’s belief that the lenders are not able to impact the impartiality of EY or assert any influence over the investment companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex whose shares the lenders own or the applicable investment company’s investment adviser.  In addition, the individuals at EY who arranged EY’s lending relationships have no oversight of, or ability to influence, the individuals at EY who conducted the audits of the Funds’ financial statements.        On June 20, 2016, the SEC Staff issued a “no-action” letter to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management & Research Company et al., No-Action Letter) related to similar Loan Rule issues as those described above.  In that letter, the SEC Staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an investment company that relied on the audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances.  The circumstances described in the no-action letter appear to be substantially similar to the circumstances that effected EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to the Funds.  EY confirmed to those in charge of governance of the Funds that it meets all the conditions of the no-action letter.  EY and the Funds believe that the Funds can rely on the no-action letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by EY.  In the no-action letter, the SEC Staff stated that the relief under the letter is temporary and will expire 18 months after the issuance of the letter.",,,,

River Road also provides model portfolios to Aston, which are used by Aston to manage separately managed accounts, including wrap fee program accounts.  Aston pays River Road a fee for providing model portfolios.   River Road also previously had an agreement with Aston, under which Aston provided nondiscretionary services such as back office support, administrative assistance, and marketing services, to support River Road’s provision of advisory services through third-party sponsored programs, including wrap programs.

1029452,"Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (""AMG""), a publicly traded asset management company, holds an equity interest in River Road Asset Management, LLC (“River Road”) through its holding company RRAM Acquisition, LLC (“RRAM Acquisition”). AMG’s equity interest in River Road is structured so that River Road maintains operational autonomy in managing its business.  The relationship between AMG, RRAM Acquisition and River Road is defined by an operating agreement that provides that neither AMG nor RRAM Acquisition has the authority or the ability to operate or manage River Road’s business in the normal course. Accordingly, AMG and RRAM Acquisition are not “control persons” of River Road.  AMG also holds equity interests in certain other investment advisers (""AMG Affiliates"").  Each of the AMG Affiliates, including River Road, operates autonomously and independently of AMG and of each other.  Except as described in this Form ADV, River Road does not have any business dealings with these AMG Affiliates and does not conduct any joint operations with them. River Road carries out its asset management activity, including the exercise of investment discretion and voting rights, independent of the AMG Affiliates.  The AMG Affiliates do not formulate advice for River Road’s clients and do not, in River Road’s view, present any potential conflict of interest with River Road’s clients.  Consequently, individual information on each AMG Affiliates is not listed in Section 7.A. of Schedule D of Part 1A of Form ADV, unless River Road has business dealings with certain AMG Affiliates. A list of all AMG Affiliates is available to River Road’s clients upon request.  River Road has mutual fund subadvisory agreements with Aston Asset Management, LLC (“Aston”), a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Funds LLC, the U.S. retail distribution arm of AMG, under which River Road serves as subadvisor to mutual funds in the Aston Funds family of mutual funds, which are sponsored and advised by Aston.  As described in each fund’s prospectus, the fund pays Aston an advisory fee, and Aston pays River Road a subadvisory fee with respect to the funds.  River Road also provides model portfolios to Aston, which are used by Aston to manage separately managed accounts, including wrap fee program accounts.  Aston pays River Road a fee for providing model portfolios.   River Road also previously had an agreement with Aston, under which Aston provided nondiscretionary services such as back office support, administrative assistance, and marketing services, to support River Road’s provision of advisory services through third-party sponsored programs, including wrap programs.  River Road has terminated this arrangement but still pays Aston a trailing fee for a set period of time from the date of termination.  River Road has a marketing agreement with AMG Funds LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG, under which AMG Funds LLC markets River Road's investment management services to unaffiliated third party intermediaries that sponsor subadvised mutual funds and/or other platforms,such as defined contribution retirement plan platforms. River Road pays AMG Funds LLC a fee for these services.   River Road also has a servicing agreement with AMG Funds LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG, under which AMG Funds LLC provides administrative and/or marketing services to support River Road’s provision of advisory services to or through various unaffiliated third-party investment programs, such as wrap programs and/or dual contract programs sponsored by unaffiliated brokerdealers, banks, and other financial intermediaries. River Road will pay AMG Funds LLC a fee for the services provided by AMG Funds LLC under these servicing arrangements.  River Road is party to a client service/marketing agreement with one or more non-U.S. subsidiaries of AMG under which the non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries introduce River Road's investment management services to prospective institutional clients and/or provide institutional client services to certain of River Road's clients in various foreign jurisdictions.

1025576,"Section 9.C. Independent Public Accountant -         Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) serves as the independent public accounting firm for the following private funds which are advised by Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc.: Deutsche Global Commodities QP Trust and Deutsche Stock Index Fund (each a “Fund”).           EY has advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified the following matters that it determined to be inconsistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) auditor independence rules.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds of financial relationships held by covered persons within EY that were in violation of the Rule 2-01(c)(1) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breaches did not and do not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.  In assessing this matter, EY indicated that upon detection the breaches were corrected promptly and that none of the breaches (i) related to financial relationships directly in the Funds, (ii) involved professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team, or (iii) were for services directly for the Funds.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that, in 2016, a pension plan for the Ernst & Young Global Limited (“EYG”) member firm in Germany (“EY Germany”), through one of its investment advisors, purchased an investment in an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that this investment was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(i) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance, EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagement.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audit of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.  In reaching this conclusion, EY noted a number of factors, including that the purchase was by EY Germany’s investment advisor without EY Germany’s permission, authorization or knowledge and EY Germany instructed its investment advisor to sell the shares of the entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Fund immediately upon detection of the purchase and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.  In addition, EY noted that the independence breach did not (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds, (ii) place EY in the position of auditing its own work, (iii) result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds, or (iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that, in 2014, the EYG member firm in Spain (“EY Spain”) completed an acquisition of a small consulting firm that had a deposit account with an overdraft line of credit at the time of the acquisition with Deutsche Bank SA Espanola, which EY Spain acquired.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that having this line of credit with an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance, EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagements.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion. In reaching this conclusion, EY noted a number of factors, including that that the credit line was terminated and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.  In addition, EY noted that the independence breach did not (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds, (ii) place EY in the position of auditing its own work, (iii) result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds, or (iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.         EY believes that the above described matters, individually and in the aggregate, do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.   Those in charge of governance of the Funds considered these matters and, based solely upon EY’s description of the facts and the representations made by EY, believe that (1) these matters did not impact EY’s application of objective and impartial judgment with respect to all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements; and (2) a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.        EY also informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified independence breaches where EY and covered persons maintain lending relationships with owners of greater than 10% of the shares of certain investment companies that are under common control with the Funds.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that these lending relationships are inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(l)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the “Loan Rule”).        The Loan Rule specifically provides that an accounting firm would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of an audit client’s equity securities.  For purposes of the Loan Rule, audit clients include the Funds as well as all registered investment companies advised by the Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. (the “Adviser”), the Funds’ investment adviser, and its affiliates, including other subsidiaries of the Adviser’s parent company, Deutsche Bank AG (collectively, the “Deutsche Funds Complex”).  EY’s lending relationships effect EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to all companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex.        EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that, after evaluating the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY has concluded that the lending relationships described above do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that its conclusion was based on a number of factors, including, among others, EY’s belief that the lenders are not able to impact the impartiality of EY or assert any influence over the investment companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex whose shares the lenders own or the applicable investment company’s investment adviser.  In addition, the individuals at EY who arranged EY’s lending relationships have no oversight of, or ability to influence, the individuals at EY who conducted the audits of the Funds’ financial statements.        On June 20, 2016, the SEC Staff issued a “no-action” letter to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management & Research Company et al., No-Action Letter) related to similar Loan Rule issues as those described above.  In that letter, the SEC Staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an investment company that relied on the audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances.  The circumstances described in the no-action letter appear to be substantially similar to the circumstances that effected EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to the Funds.  EY confirmed to those in charge of governance of the Funds that it meets all the conditions of the no-action letter.  EY and the Funds believe that the Funds can rely on the no-action letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by EY.  In the no-action letter, the SEC Staff stated that the relief under the letter is temporary and will expire 18 months after the issuance of the letter.",,,,

HIFSCO moved to dismiss and, in September 2011, the motion was granted in part and denied in part, with leave to amend the complaint. In November 2011, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on behalf of The Hartford Global Health Fund, The Hartford Conservative Allocation Fund, The Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund, The Hartford Inflation Plus Fund, The Hartford Advisors Fund, and The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund. Plaintiffs seek to rescind the investment management agreements and distribution plans between HIFSCO and these funds and to recover the total fees charged thereunder or, in the alternative, to recover any improper compensation HIFSCO received, in addition to lost earnings. HIFSCO filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint and, in December 2012, the court dismissed without prejudice the claims regarding distribution fees and denied the motion with respect to the advisory fees claims. In March 2014, the plaintiffs filed a new complaint that, among other things, added as new plaintiffs The Hartford Floating Rate Fund and The Hartford Small Company Fund and named as a defendant Hartford Funds Management Company, LLC (“HFMC”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company which assumed the role as advisor to the funds as of January 2013.

Independent Public Accountant -         Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) serves as the independent public accounting firm for the following private funds which are advised by Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc.: Deutsche Global Commodities QP Trust and Deutsche Stock Index Fund (each a “Fund”).           EY has advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified the following matters that it determined to be inconsistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) auditor independence rules.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds of financial relationships held by covered persons within EY that were in violation of the Rule 2-01(c)(1) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breaches did not and do not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.  In assessing this matter, EY indicated that upon detection the breaches were corrected promptly and that none of the breaches (i) related to financial relationships directly in the Funds, (ii) involved professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team, or (iii) were for services directly for the Funds.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that, in 2016, a pension plan for the Ernst & Young Global Limited (“EYG”) member firm in Germany (“EY Germany”), through one of its investment advisors, purchased an investment in an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that this investment was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(i) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance, EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagement.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audit of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion.  In reaching this conclusion, EY noted a number of factors, including that the purchase was by EY Germany’s investment advisor without EY Germany’s permission, authorization or knowledge and EY Germany instructed its investment advisor to sell the shares of the entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Fund immediately upon detection of the purchase and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.  In addition, EY noted that the independence breach did not (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds, (ii) place EY in the position of auditing its own work, (iii) result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds, or (iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.  •	EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that, in 2014, the EYG member firm in Spain (“EY Spain”) completed an acquisition of a small consulting firm that had a deposit account with an overdraft line of credit at the time of the acquisition with Deutsche Bank SA Espanola, which EY Spain acquired.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that having this line of credit with an entity that may be deemed to be under common control with the Funds was inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-X.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that in assessing the impact of the independence breach, in fact and appearance, EY considered all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether a reasonable investor would conclude that EY was and is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagements.  EY advised those in charge of governance of the Funds that after consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY concluded that the independence breach did not and does not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements of the Funds and that a reasonable investor would reach the same conclusion. In reaching this conclusion, EY noted a number of factors, including that that the credit line was terminated and the breach did not involve any professionals who were part of the audit engagement team for the Funds or in a position to influence the audit engagement team.  In addition, EY noted that the independence breach did not (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the Funds, (ii) place EY in the position of auditing its own work, (iii) result in EY acting as management or an employee of the Funds, or (iv) place EY in a position of being an advocate of the Funds.         EY believes that the above described matters, individually and in the aggregate, do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.   Those in charge of governance of the Funds considered these matters and, based solely upon EY’s description of the facts and the representations made by EY, believe that (1) these matters did not impact EY’s application of objective and impartial judgment with respect to all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements; and (2) a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.        EY also informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that EY had identified independence breaches where EY and covered persons maintain lending relationships with owners of greater than 10% of the shares of certain investment companies that are under common control with the Funds.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that these lending relationships are inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(l)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (referred to as the “Loan Rule”).        The Loan Rule specifically provides that an accounting firm would not be independent if it receives a loan from a lender that is a record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of an audit client’s equity securities.  For purposes of the Loan Rule, audit clients include the Funds as well as all registered investment companies advised by the Deutsche Investment Management Americas Inc. (the “Adviser”), the Funds’ investment adviser, and its affiliates, including other subsidiaries of the Adviser’s parent company, Deutsche Bank AG (collectively, the “Deutsche Funds Complex”).  EY’s lending relationships effect EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to all companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex.        EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that, after evaluating the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, EY has concluded that the lending relationships described above do not and will not impair EY’s ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that EY has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within EY’s audit engagements.  EY informed those in charge of governance of the Funds that its conclusion was based on a number of factors, including, among others, EY’s belief that the lenders are not able to impact the impartiality of EY or assert any influence over the investment companies in the Deutsche Funds Complex whose shares the lenders own or the applicable investment company’s investment adviser.  In addition, the individuals at EY who arranged EY’s lending relationships have no oversight of, or ability to influence, the individuals at EY who conducted the audits of the Funds’ financial statements.        On June 20, 2016, the SEC Staff issued a “no-action” letter to another mutual fund complex (see Fidelity Management & Research Company et al., No-Action Letter) related to similar Loan Rule issues as those described above.  In that letter, the SEC Staff confirmed that it would not recommend enforcement action against an investment company that relied on the audit services performed by an audit firm that was not in compliance with the Loan Rule in certain specified circumstances.  The circumstances described in the no-action letter appear to be substantially similar to the circumstances that effected EY’s independence under the Loan Rule with respect to the Funds.  EY confirmed to those in charge of governance of the Funds that it meets all the conditions of the no-action letter.  EY and the Funds believe that the Funds can rely on the no-action letter to continue to issue financial statements that are audited by EY.  In the no-action letter, the SEC Staff stated that the relief under the letter is temporary and will expire 18 months after the issuance of the letter.",,,,

1033460,"Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (""AMG""), a publicly traded asset management company, holds an equity interest in Chicago Equity Partners, LLC (“CEP”) through its holding company Chicago Acquisition, LLC (“Chicago Acquisition”). AMG’s equity interest in CEP is structured so that CEP maintains operational autonomy in managing its business.  The relationship between AMG, Chicago Acquisition and CEP is defined by an operating agreement that provides that neither AMG nor Chicago Acquisition has the authority or the ability to operate or manage CEP’s business in the normal course. Accordingly, AMG and Chicago Acquisition are not “control persons” of CEP.  AMG also holds equity interests in certain other investment advisers (""AMG Affiliates""). Each of the AMG Affiliates, including CEP, operates autonomously and independently of AMG and of each other. Except as described in this Form ADV, CEP does not have any business dealings with these AMG Affiliates and does not conduct any joint operations with them. CEP carries out its asset management activity, including the exercise of investment discretion and voting rights independent of the AMG Affiliates. The AMG Affiliates do not formulate advice for CEP’s clients and do not, in CEP’s view, present any potential conflict of interest with CEP’s clients. Consequently, individual information on each AMG Affiliate is not listed in Section 7.A. of Schedule D of Part 1A of Form ADV, unless CEP has business dealings with certain AMG Affiliates. A list of all AMG Affiliates is available to CEP’s clients upon request.  CEP has a marketing agreement(s) with AMG Funds LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG, under which AMG Funds LLC markets CEP's investment management services to unaffiliated third party intermediaries that sponsor subadvised mutual funds and/or other platforms, such as defined contribution retirement plan platforms. CEP pays AMG Funds LLC a fee for these services.   CEP has mutual fund subadvisory agreement(s) with AMG Funds LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG, under which CEP serves as subadvisor to one or more mutual funds in the AMG Funds family of mutual funds, which are sponsored and advised by AMG Funds LLC. As described in each fund’s prospectus, the fund pays AMG Funds LLC an advisory fee, and AMG Funds LLC pays CEP a subadvisory fee with respect to the fund. In addition, certain of CEP's employees are registered representatives of AMG Distributors, Inc., a limited purpose broker-dealer that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG Funds LLC and that is the underwriter of the AMG Funds family of funds and placement agent for certain Affiliate private funds.  CEP has a servicing agreement(s) with AMG Funds LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG, under which AMG Funds LLC provides administrative and/or marketing services to support CEP's provision of advisory services to or through various unaffiliated third-party investment programs, such as wrap programs and/or dual contract programs sponsored by unaffiliated broker-dealers, banks, and other financial intermediaries. CEP pays AMG Funds LLC a fee for the services provided by AMG Funds LLC under these servicing arrangements.    CEP is party to a client service/marketing agreement with one or more non-U.S. subsidiaries of AMG under which the non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries introduce CEP's investment management services to prospective institutional clients and/or provide institutional client services to certain of CEP's clients in various foreign jurisdictions. CEP pays the non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries a fee for these services. The non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries are not broker-dealers, investment advisers, or any of the other financial institutions described in Item 7.A. of Form ADV Part 1A.

1032822,"Amendment filed July 8, 2016 – HIMCO is filing this amendment with respect to certain of the Private Funds listed in Schedule 7.B. as follows: Cervidae Multi-Strategy LLC Q.11 has been revised to include the assets that were used for purposes of GIPS® AUM, The Hartford’s 10-K filing and HIMCO’s Form PF filing. The underlying hedge fund investments in this Private Fund are priced on a one-month delay. Hartford Institutional Trust Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) Series, Hartford Institutional Trust Unconstrained Bond Series, Tiers Wolcott Synthetic CDO Floating Rate Credit Linked Trust, Series 2007-30 and Tiers Wolcott Synthetic CDO Floating Rate Credit Linked Trust, Series 2007-31 Q11 have been revised to show the gross asset value for each of these Private Funds instead of the notional value which was in the original annual update filing.   The Aggregate Assets under Management and Regulatory Assets under Management were also updated to reflect the updated values that were received from US Bank (the Trustee) on the two Tiers Wolcott Series after the ADV was prepared.  5.E(7) Hartford Investment Management (""HIMCO"") is reimbursed for costs incurred for providing investment services to affiliated insurance companies and investment companies. Expenses for managing affiliated companies' assets are identified to insurance affiliates on an aggregate level. The investment companies' adviser may independently calculate an estimated sub-adviser fee allocated to HIMCO based upon such adviser's allocation method.   7.B.(1) Q. 13-16: Tiers Wolcott Synthetic CDO Floating Rate Credit Linked Trust, Series 2007-30 Through 2007-31 (each a ""fund""). HIMCO does not have access to information on beneficial owners of the fund sufficient to enable HIMCO to state definitively total numbers or percentages of types or domiciles, of the current beneficial owners. Legal ownership of all or most of the fund's securities is held by, and registered in the name of, Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") or a DTC nominee.  The trustee of the fund makes payments on securities issued by the fund to DTC participants (typically banks or other financial institutions but not themselves beneficial owners) based upon information provided by DTC, or in limited instances makes payment to a beneficial owner, but does not have access to the identities of all beneficial owners.  HIMCO has requested from the trustee a list of beneficial owners, but the information available is limited to DTC participant information and not beneficial owners. Thus, the information HIMCO has provided is not necessarily definitive or current and is instead based on information HIMCO has obtained from sources such as Bloomberg, the investment banker supervising the initial closing of the fund and contacts initiated by investors. Q. 27: Hartford Institutional Trust (""HIT""): trustee for each series is BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (""BONY""), and investment manager is HIMCO. BONY's affiliate, The Bank of New York Mellon, acts as custodian of each series assets. The trustee, or the custodian on its behalf, provides NAV calculation for each series. HIMCO is responsible for estimation methods and assumptions used in measuring fair value and provides annual audited financial statements to beneficial owners. Q. 23: no financials provided for series with no assets.   Legal - The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (""HFSG""), parent of HIMCO, and its subsidiaries are involved in legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. Management expects that ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of HFSG. Given the unpredictability of litigation, an adverse outcome in certain matters could, periodically, have a material adverse effect on HFSG 's consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

1019808,"Schedule D, Section 1.B. lists certain of Highbridge Capital Management LLC’s (“Registrant”) relying advisers and the respective jurisdiction of such relying advisers.  Registrant and its relying advisers are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance, among other things, on the position expressed by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission in its letter dated 1/18/12 to the American Bar Association, Business law Section.    In response to Item 3.A and C, Registrant’s relying advisers, Highbridge Capital Management (UK), Ltd. and Highbridge Capital Management (Hong Kong), Limited, are organized as a U.K. limited company and a Hong Kong limited company, respectively.  Each of the relying advisers serve as adviser and/or subadviser to certain of the private funds listed on Schedule D.  Refer to Schedule A for the direct ownership of the Relying Advisers and Schedule B for indirect ownership of the Relying Advisers, as applicable.  A Form ADV filed by Highbridge Principal Strategies, LLC (“HPS”) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2016, at which time HPS, currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Registrant, ceased to be a relying adviser of the Registrant.  In conjunction with such filing, the following relying advisers became relying advisers of HPS and are no longer relying advisers of the Registrant: Highbridge Mezzanine Partners, LLC, Highbridge Mezzanine Partners II, LLC, Constellation Growth Capital LLC, CVC III Partners LLC and Highbridge Principal Strategies (UK), LLP.  In addition, on or before March 31, 2016, the Registrant shall assign all of its rights and obligations under certain investment management agreements with private funds to HPS.  The private funds advised and/or subadvised by HPS and its relying advisers, including those that will become clients of HPS as of March 31, 2016, have been removed from the list of private funds in Schedule D.  In February 2016, JPMorgan Asset Management Holdings Inc. (“JPMAM”) and the senior executives of HPS entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the acquisition of HPS and its subsidiaries from JPMAM by certain principals of HPS (the “Transaction”).  JPMAM is the parent company of the Registrant and is a wholly owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPM”).  It is expected that the Transaction will close as of March 31, 2016, resulting in a change of control of HPS.  Following the consummation of the Transaction, HPS will not be a subsidiary of the Registrant and will be treated as independent from JPM. However, JPMAM will retain a non-voting minority interest in HPS.  The information provided by the Registrant in this Form ADV 1A assumes and reflects the consummation of the Transaction.  Accordingly, neither HPS nor its affiliated entities are listed as related persons of the Registrant on Schedule D, Section 7.A.  In connection with the Transaction, it is expected that Scott Kapnick, who is currently the Chief Executive Officer of both the Registrant and HPS, will resign as CEO of the Registrant and serve as Non-Executive Chairman and Senior Advisor of the Registrant for a transition period following the Transaction.  Certain other executive personnel changes, including the appointment of a new General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer, of the Registrant will be made in connection with the Transaction.  Such personnel changes have been reflected in Schedule A.    Registrant has a supplementary list of related persons who are not listed in Schedule D, Section 7.A because Registrant (1) has no business dealings with the related person in connection with advisory services provided to clients, (2) does not conduct shared operations with the related person, (3) does not refer clients or business to the related person, and the related person does not refer prospective clients or business to Registrant, (4) does not share supervised persons or premises with the related person; and (5) has no reason to believe that the relationship with the related person otherwise creates a conflict of interest with Registrant’s clients.  Registrant will provide a copy of the supplementary list upon request.    Certain private funds sponsored and/or managed by third parties and/or Registrant’s affiliates invest in various private funds listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).  Registrant does not have an investment advisory relationship with any of these private funds and, therefore, such private funds are not listed as private funds on Section 7.B.(1) or as “feeder funds” in response to Section 7.B.(1).A.6.(B), or taken into account with respect to Registrant’s responses to Item 5.C.or 5.D.   In addition to the minimum investment amounts specified in response to Schedule D, Section 7.B. (1) A.12, Series D units of Highbridge Capital Multi-Strategy Unit Trust require a minimum investment amount of ¥1,000,000,000, Class E shares and Class H shares of Highbridge Capital Corporation require a minimum investment amount of €10,000,000 and Class F shares of Highbridge Capital Corporation require a minimum investment amount of £10,000,000.  Each prime broker, custodian, marketer and administrator listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B. (1) with respect to a particular private fund is the entity with which the private fund has entered into a core terms agreement or similar agreement governing the overall relationship between the fund and such service provider.  A prime broker, custodian, marketer or administrator, in fulfilling its obligations under a core terms or similar agreement, may use the services of one or more affiliated U.S. or non-U.S. entities.

In 2002, two judgments were entered: against Vincent and Robert Andrews jointly in an amount totaling $984,526.00; against Vincent Andrews in an amount totaling $1,173,913.00; and against Robert Andrews in an amount totaling $2,113,043.00, all plus interest. Currently, a proceeding is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut (Civ. No. 3:08CV778-78 1 (AWT)) to determine whether these judgments remain unsatisfied.  The 2002 judgments contained no findings regarding investment-related statutes or regulations. Rather, the judgments addressed California common law claims only, stemming from oral contracts formed between the Andrews and the former clients prior to the contemplation of investment-related services. The clients maintained that these oral contracts precluded the Andrews from subsequently receiving additional, otherwise permissible compensation for locating and recommending tax-advantaged partnership investments, even though this additional compensation was disclosed to the clients in short, written forms which the clients countersigned.  Two members of a Ninth Circuit panel ultimately held that the clients were entitled to rely on the Andrews’ original oral representations and not read “the documents tendered them” subsequently. The remaining Ninth Circuit judge disagreed because the Andrews had given their clients “the plainest notice of the additional charges.”",,,,

On 09/30/12, Chevy Chase Trust Company (“CCTC”), an affiliate and trustee of the bank collective fund called ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund, converted the ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund’s subsidiary (ASB Allegiance Holdings) into a limited partnership called the ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund L.P (“LP”).  The General Partner for the LP is an indirect subsidiary of ASB Capital Management LLC (“ASBCM”) called ASB Allegiance Real Estate Partners GP, LLC.  As such, the General Partner is deemed to have custody of the LP.  ASBCM has obtained cash management services of Capital One Bank and custody services of Wells Fargo Bank.  Deloitte and Touche LLP has been retained to perform an annual financial statement audit in accordance with GAAP.  For reporting purposes, the amounts listed in Item 9(A)(2) include cash and direct real estate investments of the LP.  The bank collective fund's assets, which holds units of the LP and cash, continue to be reported in item 9(B)(2).  Chevy Chase Trust Company, an affiliate, discovered during an internal review that one of its outside accountants for three bank collective funds for which ASBCM serves as investment adviser was not PCAOB-registered.  As a result, Chevy Chase Trust Company has requested the accounting firm responsible for performing the annual surprise custody exam to expand its scope to include these funds in the surprise custody exams going forward.",,,,

The transactions for funds and accounts managed by this independent advisory entity are generally subject to VAAM’s trading policies and procedures, including those governing trade allocations. The commissions and other revenues these funds and accounts generate for broker-dealers and other financial institutions are seen as coming from VAAM’s trading desk and generally help VAAM obtain better services and allocations on behalf of funds and clients from these broker-dealers and financial institutions; the commissions and other revenues generated by these funds and accounts may be considered by both VAAM and underwriters in allocating initial public offerings (“IPOs”) and other offerings.

Series comprising separate “private funds” for purposes of Form ADV are not counted as separate accounts for this item.  The amount of regulatory assets under management reflects January 1, 2016 opening account balances  Item 7.A.  Certain related persons of the registrant exercise control or investment discretion over family investment vehicles for which they receive no compensation. These vehicles are not listed on Item 7A of Schedule D.   Item 7.B.  The registrant has created, and from time to time may create, special purpose vehicles that are utilized by its advisory clients and proprietary account to implement portions of their investment strategies.   The financial statements and investor account statements sent to investors in the registrant’s private funds that hold an interest in any SPV include all applicable information for such SPVs.   The registrant lists private funds existing as of the date hereof. For such funds, current gross asset value is regulatory assets under management for such fund or applicable master-feeder structure as of opening account balances on January 1, 2016. For reporting the approximate number of the private fund's beneficial owners, investor accounts are consolidated to the extent that beneficiaries thereof are known. The percentage of any private fund beneficially owned by the registrant or its related persons does not reflect deferred management or accrued incentive fees invested in such fund.  When calculating the percentage ownership of a private fund, deferred management and accrued incentive fees invested in such private fund are excluded from the denominator. Beneficial ownership amounts are based on net asset values. The registrant is a third party manager to P Monarch Recovery Fund Ltd.  As a result, the registrant does not have direct access to complete or current information and the accuracy of certain information presented in response to Item 7B of Schedule D is dependent on the accuracy of the information provided by such client to the registrant.  Stated minimum investment amounts are subject to waiver and generally are waived under certain circumstances. For those private funds reported as registered with Finland, Norway, South Korea or Sweden, the registration is for marketing purposes within the jurisdiction.   Item 9.  The registrant and certain of its related persons have technical custody of assets held in master funds, feeder funds or special purpose vehicles that hold investments.  To avoid double-counting, the aggregate assets attributable to a master-feeder structure and underlying SPVs are presented (e.g., the value of master fund assets invested in a special purpose vehicle are not counted twice).  For purposes of this item, master-feeder structures are treated as a single account and special purpose vehicles holding assets attributable to such master funds are excluded although the assets are counted once, as explained above. Series comprising separate clients for purposes of Item 5C and separate “private funds” for purposes of Schedule D, Item 7B, are not counted as separate client accounts for Item 9.  This counting methodology is consistent with the approach taken in Item 5.F. The dollar amount of funds and securities shown is calculated in the same manner as regulatory assets under management except that uncalled capital commitments are excluded.  Consistent with registrant’s response to Item 5.F., the dollar amount of funds and securities is as of opening account balances on January 1, 2016.   As between the registrant and its related persons that act as general partner to certain of the registrant’s clients (each, a “GP”), accounts and assets are attributed to the registrant except where a GP acts a general partner for the master fund of a master-feeder structure.   Item 10.  Co-founder Christopher Santana has indirect ownership that is not disclosed on Schedule B because it is close to, but does not meet the reporting threshold.

With respect to this filing, LSNAA is the “filing adviser” and LSGA and LSNAA(NY) are the “relying advisers.”  The general partners of private funds advised by the Registrants are not separately registering as investment advisers, in reliance on the positions expressed by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its letter to the American Bar Association, Business Law Section, dated December 8, 2005, and in the ABA II Letter.   The general partners receive performance-based fees from the private funds; LSNAA, LSGA and LSNAA(NY) do not receive performance-based fees from the private funds.  Certain non-U.S. investment advisers identified in Section 7.A. of Schedule D are “Participating Affiliates” of LSGA as that term is used in relief granted by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowing U.S. registered advisers to use investment advisory and trading resources of unregistered advisory affiliates subject to the regulatory supervision of the registered adviser and related conditions.  The private funds advised by the Registrants have entered into co-investment agreements pursuant to which certain entities have the right and obligation to invest, on a side-by-side basis and on the same economic terms, in each investment of the private funds.  These “co-investment vehicles” are structured to facilitate investments by certain employees, officers, directors, managers and consultants (“key employees”) of LSGA, LSNAA, LSNAA(NY) and their related persons in the investments of the private funds.  The co-investment vehicles do not pay advisory fees to the Registrants, and key employees may directly or indirectly receive loans from the Registrants or their related persons with respect to a significant portion of their investment in the co-investment vehicles.  Investments may be initially funded by the private funds, and are re-allocated to the co-investment vehicles. The terms of the co-investment vehicles are disclosed in the private funds’ offering documents, including their private placement memoranda and governing documents.  Each private fund listed in Section 7.B. of Schedule D holds certain assets through one or more underlying entities (“SPVs”) whose primary purpose is to hold assets on the private funds’ behalf.  Certain related persons of the Registrants are partners or directors of certain SPVs, or serve in a similar capacity.  These SPVs are not disclosed separately in Section 7.B. of Schedule D.  Assets held by the SPVs include funds, securities, and non-securities, such as real estate assets.  Due to the difficulty of distinguishing these asset types for reporting purposes, the Registrants’ responses to Item 9.A.(2) and Item 9.B.(2) reflect all assets of each private fund managed by the Registrants, including non-securities.  The general partners of certain private funds for which a “no” answer is provided to Question 28.(a) of Section 7.B. of Schedule D used the services of one or more marketers during their fundraising periods (which are now closed).",,,,

We are not able to provide information concerning the audit PAG believes would be required with respect to a fund managed by Aequitas Investment Management, an investment adviser under common control with PAG through the court-appointed receiver responsible for overseeing Aequitas-related receivership entities. PAG does not itself have custody of client assets (and does not currently deduct fees from any Aequitas-related investment held in PAG client accounts) and is not required to obtain audits under the custody rule. PAG typically obtains information about the audit from Aequitas' affiliates. The Aequitas affiliates have been taken over by the court-appointed receiver.

Accordingly PAG does not know whether Aequitas Investment Management obtained the required audit report(s) during the prior year, or engaged an auditor to perform the audit.

Aequitas held its indirect ownership stake in PAG through Aspen Grove Equity Solutions, LLC (“Aspen Grove”).  In the Receivership Order entered by the court, numerous Aequitas affiliates, including Aspen Grove, were deemed ""Receivership Entities.""  The Receivership Order further directed that ""The trustees, directors, officers, members of the Receivership Entity are hereby dismissed and the powers of any general partners, directors, members and/or managers are hereby suspended."" Control of the Receivership Entities is now in the hands of the receiver, Ronald F. Greenspan. Accordingly, we have removed all other indirect owners and retained only Aspen Grove. We have added Ronald Greenspan directly to the Schedule B, pulling that name as input into the IARD system, however there is limited identifying information associated with that name.

With respect to this filing, HAM is the “filing adviser” and HAL is the “relying adviser.”  Certain non-U.S. investment advisers identified in Section 7.A. of Schedule D are “Participating Affiliates” of HAL as that term is used in relief granted by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowing U.S. registered advisers to use investment advisory and trading resources of unregistered advisory affiliates subject to the regulatory supervision of the registered adviser and related conditions. Certain of the private funds advised by the Registrants have entered into co-investment agreements pursuant to which certain entities have the right and obligation to invest, on a side-by-side basis and on the same economic terms, in each investment of the private funds.  These “co-investment vehicles” are structured to facilitate investments by certain employees, officers, directors, managers and consultants (“key employees”) of HAL, HAM, and their related persons in the investments of the private funds.  The co-investment vehicles do not pay advisory fees to the Registrants, and key employees may directly or indirectly receive loans from the Registrants or their related persons with respect to a significant portion of their investment in the co-investment vehicles.  Investments may be initially funded by the private funds, and are re-allocated to the co-investment vehicles. The terms of the co-investment vehicles are disclosed in the private funds’ offering documents, including their private placement memoranda and governing documents. Each private fund listed in Section 7.B. of Schedule D holds certain assets through one or more underlying entities (“SPVs”) whose primary purpose is to hold assets on the private funds’ behalf.  Certain related persons of the Registrants are partners or directors of certain SPVs, or serve in a similar capacity.  These SPVs are not disclosed separately in Section 7.B. of Schedule D. Assets held by the SPVs include funds, securities, and non-securities, such as real estate assets.  Due to the difficulty of distinguishing these asset types for reporting purposes, the Registrants’ responses to Item 9.A.(2) and Item 9.B.(2) reflect all assets of each private fund managed by the Registrants, including non-securities.

Item 5.C.(2): The figure reported in Item 5.C.(2) is accurate as of the filing date of this Form ADV Part 1.  Item 5.F.(2) and Item 9.A.(2):   Avenue-CDP Global Opportunities Fund, L.P.

Pursuant to a global services agreement, each of AEIM and AACM may provide investment, administrative and risk management services to Avenue PPF and its general partner, Avenue PPF Opportunities Fund GenPar, LLC.      The Advisor, AEIM and AACM have entered into an investment management agreement with Avenue Gabriel Fund, L.P.

Pursuant to a subadvisory agreement between the Advisor and AEIM and AACM, each of AEIM and AACM are expected to provide investment services to the Advisor with respect to the Advisor’s management of Avenue US/Europe Distressed Segregated Portfolio.      The entire value of the assets of CDP, COPPERS, Avenue PPF, Avenue Gabriel and Avenue US/Europe Distressed Segregated Portfolio is included in the regulatory assets under management of the Advisor, and custody of CDP’s, COPPERS’, Avenue PPF’s, Avenue Gabriel’s and Avenue US/Europe Distressed Segregated Portfolio’s assets is attributable to the Advisor.    The number of accounts reported in these items is accurate as of the filing date of this Form ADV Part 1.  Section 7.A. of Schedule D:  The Advisor has related persons who are omitted from Section 7.A. of Schedule D of the Advisor’s Form ADV.  As a general matter, the Advisor’s business activities do not involve such omitted related persons.  The omitted related persons are general partners and/or sub-advisers to private funds managed by other affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group and are listed in each such adviser’s respective Section 7.A. of Schedule D.    In addition, SPVs created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which are wholly-owned by the Advisor and/or its affiliates are not listed in Section 7.A. or Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, and do not carry out substantive business activities or function as “private funds.”  In addition, an SPV created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which accept investments from third-parties that are unaffiliated with the Advisor is not listed in Section 7.A. or Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D so long as the SPV: (i) is a non-U.S. entity that does not use U.S. jurisdictional means to offer or sell its securities; or (ii) does not invest directly in securities.      The Advisor is affiliated with AMROC Investments, LLC  (“AMROC”).  AMROC is not a broker-dealer of securities and is not registered with FINRA.    Boulevard Acquisition Sponsor II, LLC (“Boulevard”) is a related person of the Advisor.  Boulevard is the sponsor of a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting an M&A transaction. 	 Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D:  Q. 13-16 for Certain Funds:  For Lyxor/Avenue Opportunities Fund Limited, the responses to Q. 13-16 are either best estimates or “0” because the Advisor does not have access to, and is not required to maintain, such information.  Q. 14:  Where a private fund that has a closed-end structure is in liquidation, investors are returned their capital before the Advisor receives its incentive fee or allocation.  As investors are returned their capital, their percentage ownership in the fund diminishes and the general partner’s interest increases. This may result in the Advisor and/or its related persons having a pecuniary interest in excess of 25% of a fund, and in certain circumstances, 100% of a fund’s pecuniary interest.  Q. 18: The entity set forth in response to Q. 3 of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has delegated all investment authority to the Advisor; such entity does not advise the fund(s). Entities listed in Q. 18, if any, provide sub-advisory services to the applicable fund, but the Advisor continues to have investment authority.  Q. 23 for Employee Participation Plans: For each of Avenue Employee Participation Plan, LLC and Avenue Real Estate Employee Participation Plan, LLC, the responses to Q. 23(a) are “no” and responses to Q. 23(b-h) are left blank because these funds are not individually audited. However, the Employee Participation Plans invest in funds affiliated with the Advisor, which are audited.    Q. 27: For certain private funds, the administrator of the fund has been engaged to conduct an independent valuation analysis of a private fund’s portfolio in accordance with the fund’s valuation policies and procedures. If the Advisor’s valuation results fall within an acceptable range of the administrator’s calculations, then the Advisor’s valuation amounts are accepted by  the administrator. In such instances, we have responded “0%” to Q. 27 because the administrator conducts its valuation based on the fund’s (i.e., an affiliate of the Advisor) valuation policies and procedures.  Q. 21 and 28 – Consolidated Master-Feeder Structure Entries: Responses to one or more consolidated questions in Section 7.B.(1) may not be applicable to the master fund.  The response in Q. 21 will be “No” for a master fund if it relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, while one or more consolidated feeder funds will have relied upon Reg. D promulgated under such Act. With respect to Q. 28, while a feeder fund may have utilized a marketer in respect of its investors, generally a master fund would not require such services.   Q.28: The agreement between the Advisor and any marketer listed in Q. 28 may include affiliates of the marketer.  As of the filing date of this Form ADV Part 1, Avenue Credit Opportunities Fund, L.P. was added.  As of June 21, 2016, Avenue CLO Fund, Ltd., Avenue CLO Fund II, Ltd. and Avenue CLO Fund III, Ltd. were removed because each fund has been fully liquidated.  Items 8.A.(1) & 8.G.(1)-(2): The Advisor has neither engaged in principal transactions nor received soft dollar benefits in its most recent fiscal year, but may do so in the future.  Certain non-execution products and services may be provided by executing brokers, including, without limitation, research, corporate access, and capital introduction events.  There is no expectation of order flow or any agreement to “pay up” for these products or services, however, and the Advisor does not believe that these constitute soft dollar items. To the extent that soft dollars are used in the future, any products or services acquired using soft dollars will be consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Schedules A & B: For entities which the Advisor does not control, the Advisor does not have the information required by Schedules A & B. In these cases, such information has not been provided.",,,,

Under the SEC's auditor independence rule as set forth under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, an auditor is not considered ""independent"" if it receives a loan from the record or beneficial owner of more than 10% of an audit client's equity securities. This non-compliance covers the audit of financial statements performed pursuant to the custody rule for 2012-2014 for LOF and certain other affiliated funds, as well as the audit of financial statements for LOF and certain other affiliated funds for 2015, which were ongoing at the time we were notified by PwC.  Based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances related to this matter, PwC and Landmark Equity Advisors LLC each concluded that this matter did not compromise or impair PwC's integrity and objectivity with respect to conducting its audits and no aspect of the audit for years 2012-14 was affected or influenced, and the audit for 2015 would not be affected or influenced, by virtue of ownership by lender of more than 10% of the equity interests of LOF.",,,,

With respect to this filing, LSNAA is the “filing adviser” and LSGA and LSNAA(NY) are the “relying advisers.”  The general partners of private funds advised by the Registrants are not separately registering as investment advisers, in reliance on the positions expressed by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in its letter to the American Bar Association, Business Law Section, dated December 8, 2005, and in the ABA II Letter.   The general partners receive performance-based fees from the private funds; LSNAA, LSGA and LSNAA(NY) do not receive performance-based fees from the private funds.  Certain non-U.S. investment advisers identified in Section 7.A. of Schedule D are “Participating Affiliates” of LSGA as that term is used in relief granted by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowing U.S. registered advisers to use investment advisory and trading resources of unregistered advisory affiliates subject to the regulatory supervision of the registered adviser and related conditions.  The private funds advised by the Registrants have entered into co-investment agreements pursuant to which certain entities have the right and obligation to invest, on a side-by-side basis and on the same economic terms, in each investment of the private funds.  These “co-investment vehicles” are structured to facilitate investments by certain employees, officers, directors, managers and consultants (“key employees”) of LSGA, LSNAA, LSNAA(NY) and their related persons in the investments of the private funds.  The co-investment vehicles do not pay advisory fees to the Registrants, and key employees may directly or indirectly receive loans from the Registrants or their related persons with respect to a significant portion of their investment in the co-investment vehicles.  Investments may be initially funded by the private funds, and are re-allocated to the co-investment vehicles. The terms of the co-investment vehicles are disclosed in the private funds’ offering documents, including their private placement memoranda and governing documents.  Each private fund listed in Section 7.B. of Schedule D holds certain assets through one or more underlying entities (“SPVs”) whose primary purpose is to hold assets on the private funds’ behalf.  Certain related persons of the Registrants are partners or directors of certain SPVs, or serve in a similar capacity.  These SPVs are not disclosed separately in Section 7.B. of Schedule D.  Assets held by the SPVs include funds, securities, and non-securities, such as real estate assets.  Due to the difficulty of distinguishing these asset types for reporting purposes, the Registrants’ responses to Item 9.A.(2) and Item 9.B.(2) reflect all assets of each private fund managed by the Registrants, including non-securities.  The general partners of certain private funds for which a “no” answer is provided to Question 28.(a) of Section 7.B. of Schedule D used the services of one or more marketers during their fundraising periods (which are now closed).",,,,
