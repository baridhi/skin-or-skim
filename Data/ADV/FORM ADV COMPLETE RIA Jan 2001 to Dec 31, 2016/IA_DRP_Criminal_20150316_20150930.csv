THE INQUIRY HAS ENCOMPASSED CERTAIN TRADING BY MR. BRONFMAN IN VIVENDI STOCK.  SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING MR. BRONFMAN AND THE FORMER CEO, CFO AND COO OF VIVENDI, HAD BEEN GIVEN THE STATUS OF ""MIS EN EXAMEN"" IN CONNECTION WITH THE INQUIRY.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EQUIVALENT TO ""MIS EN EXAMEN"" IN THE U.S. SYSTEM OF JURISPRUDENCE, IT IS A PRELIMINARY STAGE OF PROCEEDINGS THAT DOES NOT ENTAIL ANY FILING OF CHARGES.  IN JANUARY 2009, THE PARIS PUBLIC PROSECUTOR FORMALLY RECOMMENDED THAT NO CHARGES BE FILED AND THAT MR.  BRONFMAN NOT BE REFERRED FOR TRIAL.  ON OCTOBER 22, 2009, THE INVESTIGATING MAGISTRATE REJECTED THE PROSECUTOR'S RECOMMENDATION AND RELEASED AN ORDER REFERRING FOR TRIAL MR. BRONFMAN AND SIX OTHER INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING THE FORMER CEO, CFO AND COO OF VIVENDI.  WHILE THE INQUIRY ENCOMPASSED VARIOUS ISSUES, MR. BRONFMAN WAS REFERRED FOR TRIAL SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TRADING IN VIVENDI STOCK.  IN JUNE 2010, MR. BRONFMAN WAS PART OF A TRIAL IN THE TRIAL COURT IN PARIS AT WHICH THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AND THE LEAD CIVIL CLAIMANT BOTH TOOK THE POSITION THAT MR.  BRONFMAN SHOULD BE ACQUITTED.  ON JANUARY 21, 2011, THE COURT FOUND MR.  BRONFMAN GUILTY OF THE CHARGE RELATING TO HIS TRADING IN VIVENDI STOCK, FOUND HIM NOT LIABLE TO THE CIVIL CLAIMANTS, AND IMPOSED A FINE OF 5 MILLION EUROS AND A SUSPENDED SENTENCE OF 15 MONTHS.  MR. BRONFMAN APPEALED THE TRIAL COURT DECISION TO THE PARIS COURT OF APPEAL. IN NOVEMBER 2013, MR. BRONFMAN PARTICIPATED IN A RE-TRIAL BEFORE A NEW JUDICIAL PANEL AS PART OF HIS APPEAL OF THE PARIS TRIAL COURT'S 2011 RULING.  IN MAY 2014, THE NEW JUDICIAL PANEL RENDERED ITS DECISION.   THE NEW JUDICIAL PANEL AFFIRMED THE PARIS TRIAL COURT'S FINDING THAT MR. BRONFMAN WAS GUILTY OF THE CHARGE, BUT STATED THAT ITS FINDING WOULD APPEAR ONLY IN FRENCH JUDICIAL RECORDS AND NOT MR. BRONFMAN'S PUBLIC RECORD, REMOVED THE SUSPENDED SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE PARIS TRIAL COURT AND SUSPENDED 2.5 MILLION EUROS OF THE ORIGINAL FINE OF 5 MILLION EUROS.  THE NEW JUDICIAL PANEL AFFIRMED THE PARIS TRIAL COURT'S FINDING THAT MR. BRONFMAN WAS NOT LIABLE TO THE CIVIL CLAIMANTS.  MR. BRONFMAN HAS APPEALED THE VERDICT AND BELIEVES THAT HIS TRADING IN VIVENDI STOCK WAS PROPER.  UNDER FRENCH LAW, THE PENALTY IS SUSPENDED PENDING THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE CASE."

PRIVATE BANKERS BASED IN SWITZERLAND SOLICITED U.S. CLIENTS TO OPEN UNDECLARED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE PROTECTION OFFERED BY SWISS BANK SECRECY LAWS, WHICH ALLOWED U.S. CLIENTS TO AVOID DISCLOSURE OF THEIR OWNERSHIP OF THE ACCOUNTS AND AVOID OBLIGATIONS TO PAY U.S. TAXES.  CSAG ASSISTED SOME U.S. CLIENTS IN ENSURING THAT THEIR OWNERSHIP OF UNDECLARED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS WOULD NOT BE APPARENT.  DUE IN PART TO THE ASSISTANCE OF CSAG AND ITS RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS, NUMEROUS U.S. CLIENTS -- WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT SWISS BANK SECRECY LAWS WOULD PREVENT CSAG FROM DISCLOSING THEIR IDENTITIES TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS"") -- FILED FALSE TAX RETURNS WITH THE IRS THAT FAILED TO DISCLOSE THEIR INTERESTS IN UNDECLARED ACCOUNTS AND RELATED INCOME.  NONE OF THE CONDUCT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CREDIT SUISSE ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC OR ANY CSAG AFFILIATE THAT IS REGISTERED WITH THE COMMISSION AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER OR BROKER-DEALER. ON MAY 19, 2014, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILED A ONE-COUNT CRIMINAL INFORMATION IN THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA CHARGING CSAG WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT TAX FRAUD RELATED TO ACCOUNTS CSAG ESTABLISHED FOR CROSS-BORDER CLIENTS FROM 2002 UNTIL 2008 IN VIOLATION OF TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE, SECTION 371.  CSAG AGREED TO RESOLVE THE ACTION BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THROUGH A PLEA AGREEMENT DATED MAY 19, 2014.  UNDER THE PLEA AGREEMENT, CSAG PLEADED GUILTY TO THE CHARGE SET OUT IN THE INFORMATION.  CSAG EXPECTS THAT THE DISTRICT COURT WILL ENTER A JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION AGAINST CSAG THAT WILL REQUIRE REMEDIES THAT ARE MATERIALLY THE SAME AS SET FORTH IN THE PLEA AGREEMENT."

ON 16 APRIL 2002, THERE WAS A PLACEMENT BY BRIGHT INT'L GROUP LTD (""BRIGHT""), A COMPANY LISTED ON THE HONG KONG STOCK EXCHANGE (""EXCHANGE"").  THE PLACEMENT WAS PART OF A TOP-UP PLACEMENT BUT ON THIS OCCASION THE TOP-UP DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL AFTER 24 APRIL 2002.  THERE WAS AN ACQUISITION OF BRIGHT SHARES BY THE FUND ON 16 APRIL 2002 WHICH TECHNICALLY BROUGHT THE AGGREGATE INTEREST OF VPL MARGINALLY ABOVE THE 10% REPORTING THRESHOLD UNDER HONG KONG LAW AND TRIGGERED THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE DISCLOSURE TO THE EXCHANGE AND BRIGHT WITHIN 5 DAYS.  AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR, VPL USED THE ENLARGED ISSUED SHARE CAPITAL (I.E. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH THE EXISTING AND NEW SHARES) IN MAKING THE CALCULATION, LEADING TO A MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT ITS INTEREST IN BRIGHT HAD NOT PASSED THE 10% THRESHOLD.  THEREFORE, NO DISCLOSURE HAD BEEN MADE.  ON 24 APRIL 2002, FOLLOWING A SERIES OF DISPOSAL OF BRIGHT SHARES, VPL'S INTEREST IN BRIGHT FELL BELOW 10%, AND VPL WAS UNDER THE DUTY TO DISCLOSE TO THE EXCHANGE AND BRIGHT.  BECAUSE OF THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT ITS INTEREST HAD NOT PASSED THE 10% THRESHOLD, VPL WAS NOT AWARE THAT ITS DUTY OF DISCLOSURE HAD ARISEN AGAIN.  AS A RESULT OF THE NON-DISCLOSURE, THE HONG KONG SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION (""SFC"") ISSUED 4 SUMMONSES AGAINST VPL FOR FAILURE TO PERFORM DISCLOSURE DUTIES TO THE EXCHANGE AND BRIGHT WITHIN 5 DAYS; FROM 16 APRIL 2002 (1 SUMMONS FOR DISCLOSURE TO THE EXCHANGE AND 1 SUMMONS FOR DISCLOSURE TO BRIGHT) AND FROM 24 APRIL 2002 (1 SUMMONS FOR DISCLOSURE TO THE EXCHANGE AND 1 SUMMONS FOR DISCLOSURE TO BRIGHT).  VPL PLEADED GUILTY TO ALL 4 SUMMONSES ON 7 APRIL 2004 AND WAS FINED HK$4,000 (APPROX. US$510) PER SUMMONS AND PAID INVESTIGATION COSTS OF HK$29,224 (APPROX. US$3,750) TO THE SFC. NOTING THAT THE NON-DISCLOSURE STEMMED FROM A CALCULATION ERROR, SFC REGARDED THIS AS AN END OF THE MATTER AND NO FURTHER REGULATORY ACTION WILL BE TAKEN."

THE CLEVELAND ORDINANCE REQUIRES A SELLER OF REAL PROPERTY TO FURNISH TO THE PURCHASER A CERTIFICATE OF DISCLOSURE ADDRESSING THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY BEFORE ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT FOR SALE; EACH VIOLATION OF THE ORDINANCE CARRIES A MAXIMUM FINE OF $5,000. RATHER THAN IMPOSE THE MAXIMUM FINE, THE CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL COURT REDUCED THE TOTAL FINE TO A SUM OF $2,500 PER VIOLATION, OR $10,000 IN TOTAL. NOTE: FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE CERTIFICATE OF DISCLOSURE REQUIRED BY THE CLEVELAND ORDINANCE WAS DUE TO A MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT AS APPLIED TO PARTICULAR TRANSACTIONS."
